# Image Classification using TensorFlow in the MapR Data Science Refinery

In this demo we will take a transfer-learned Inception_V3 model and use it to correctly label different types of flower via image classification.

Model is taken from the Google Codelab tutorial [TensorFlow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) and has been retrained on flower photos in the data set located [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz).

* Note: you have to do some conversion on these photos or install tooling to handle JPEGs. I've uploaded 10 sample PNG flowers to the [flowers directory](/flowers/)
