# Image Classification using TensorFlow in the MapR Data Science Refinery

In this demo we will take a transfer-learned Inception_V3 model from the Google Codelab tutorial, [TensorFlow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0), that has been retrained on flower photos and use it to highlight the usefulness of seamless & persistent data access for containerized deep learning.
